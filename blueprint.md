# Health App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan, style, design, and features of the Health App. This application is designed for doctors and administrators to manage patient data and monitor their health status.

## Style and Design

The application follows a modern and clean design aesthetic, with a focus on usability and clarity.

*   **Theme:** The app supports both light and dark themes, with a primary color of deep purple and a secondary color of teal.
*   **Typography:** The app uses the Oswald and Roboto fonts for a clean and readable look.
*   **Layout:** The app uses a consistent layout across all pages, with a focus on clear and intuitive navigation.
*   **Icons:** The app uses Material Design icons to enhance usability and provide visual cues.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

*   **Login:** Users can log in as an administrator or a doctor.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can create new doctors and patients.
*   **Patient List:** Doctors can view a list of their assigned patients, with the ability to filter and search for specific patients.
*   **Patient Details:** Doctors can view detailed information about a specific patient, including their live vitals, vital trends, notes, medications, and connected devices.
*   **Profile Settings:** Users can update their profile information.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to continue to improve the UI of the application and add new features as needed. The next step is to remove the `app_colors.dart` file, since it is no longer needed.
